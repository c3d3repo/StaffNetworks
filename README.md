# StaffNetworks
Somes simple analyses of the staff network at my organisation designed to help me to better target internal communications.

## Setup Instructions
To run the Jupyter notebook on your own machine, you will need to have installed:
* Python 3.5 or 3.6.
* The following libraries:
- pandas (for data frames and simple statistics)
- numpy (for vector and matrix computations)
- plotly (for interactive plots)
- seaborn (for pretty plots)
- networkx (for network analyses and visualisation)

The easiest way to get set up is to do the following:

If you don't have Python 3.5 or 3.6, [download and install anaconda with Python 3.5 or Python 3.6](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/faq/#anaconda-faq-35)

If you already have Python 3.5 or 3.6 but don't have anaconda yet, follow [these instructions for your operating system](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ "Anaconda install instructions for different operating systems")

Anaconda should already have all the libraries installed, but if you get an error saying otherwise, you can use the installer to install them manually via the command line or terminal, e.g.  

```
conda install networkx
```
